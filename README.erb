INSTALL
  gem install main

DESCRIPTION
  main.rb features the following:

    - unification of option, argument, keyword, and environment parameter
      parsing
    - auto generation of usage and help messages
    - support for mode/sub-commands
    - io redirection support
    - logging hooks using ruby's built-in logging mechanism
    - intelligent error handling and exit codes 
    - use as dsl or library for building Main objects
    - parsing user defined ARGV and ENV
    - zero requirements for understanding the obtuse apis of *any* command
      line option parsers
    - built-in support for persistent state via sqlite/sequel/amalgalite
    - built-in support for yaml config files
    - leather pants

  in short main.rb aims to drastically lower the barrier to writing uniform
  command line applications.

  for instance, this program

    require 'main'

    Main {
      argument 'foo'
      option 'bar'

      def run
        p params['foo']
        p params['bar']
        exit_success!
      end
    }

  sets up a program which requires one argument, 'bar', and which may accept one
  command line switch, '--foo' in addition to the single option/mode which is always
  accepted and handled appropriately: 'help', '--help', '-h'.  for the most
  part main.rb stays out of your command line namespace but insists that your
  application has at least a help mode/option.

  main.rb supports sub-commands in a very simple way

    require 'main'

    Main {
      mode 'install' do
        def run() puts 'installing...' end
      end

      mode 'uninstall' do
        def run() puts 'uninstalling...' end
      end
    }

  which allows a program, called 'a.rb', to be invoked as

    ruby a.rb install

  and

    ruby a.rb uninstall

  for simple programs main.rb is a real time saver but it's for more complex
  applications where main.rb's unification of parameter parsing, class
  configuration dsl, and auto-generation of usage messages can really streamline
  command line application development.  for example the following 'a.rb'
  program:

    require 'main'

    Main {
      argument('foo'){
        cast :int
      }
      keyword('bar'){
        arity 2
        cast :float
        defaults 0.0, 1.0
      }
      option('foobar'){
        argument :optional
        description 'the foobar option is very handy'
      }
      environment('BARFOO'){
        cast :list_of_bool
        synopsis 'export barfoo=value'
      }

      def run
        p params['foo'].value
        p params['bar'].values
        p params['foobar'].value
        p params['BARFOO'].value
      end
    }

  when run with a command line of

    BARFOO=true,false,false ruby a.rb 42 bar=40 bar=2 --foobar=a

  will produce

    42
    [40.0, 2.0]
    "a"
    [true, false, false]

  while a command line of

    ruby a.rb --help

  will produce

    NAME
      a.rb

    SYNOPSIS
      a.rb foo [bar=bar] [options]+

    PARAMETERS
      * foo [ 1 -> int(foo) ]

      * bar=bar [ 2 ~> float(bar=0.0,1.0) ]

      * --foobar=[foobar] [ 1 ~> foobar ]
          the foobar option is very handy

      * --help, -h

      * export barfoo=value

  and this shows how all of argument, keyword, option, and environment parsing
  can be declartively dealt with in a unified fashion - the dsl for all
  parameter types is the same - and how auto synopsis and usage generation saves
  keystrokes.  the parameter synopsis is compact and can be read as

      * foo [ 1 -> int(foo) ]

        'one argument will get processed via int(argument_name)'

          1        : one argument
          ->       : will get processed (the argument is required)
          int(foo) : the cast is int, the arg name is foo

      * bar=bar [ 2 ~> float(bar=0.0,1.0) ]

        'two keyword arguments might be processed via float(bar=0.0,1.0)'

          2                  : two arguments
          ~>                 : might be processed (the argument is optional)
          float(bar=0.0,1.0) : the cast will be float, the default values are
                               0.0 and 1.0

      * --foobar=[foobar] [ 1 ~> foobar ]

        'one option with optional argument may be given directly'

      * --help, -h

        no synopsis, simple switch takes no args and is not required

      * export barfoo=value

        a user defined synopsis

HISTORY
  4.5.1
    - moved dotdir to state_path

  4.5.0
    - use map.rb for config objects

  4.4.0
    - app storage under a dotdir. for example

        Main {
          name :foobar
        }

      will have a ~/.foobar/ directory available for storing db/config/etc.

    - support for automatic sequel/sqlite/amalgalite dbs for persistent state
    across invocations.  the db is automatically created under the main
    programs dotdir (~/.$appname/db.sqlite)

        Main {
          db {
            create_table :foo do
              String key
              String val
            end unless table_exists? :foo
          }

          def run
            db[:foo].create(:key => 'using', :val => 'amalgalite')
          end
        }

      - support for automatic config files with auto populated template data.
      the first time the program is run the user's editor will be invoked on a
      config file pre-populate with the same config.  subsequent invocations
      will use the user configured values. the config file is stored at
      ~/.$appname/config.yml

          Main {
            config :email => 'your.addy@gmail.com', :password => 'pa$$word'

            def run
              email = config[:email]
            end
          }

      - new paramter types :pathname, :path, :slug, :input, and :output 

      - input/output parameters.  can be filenames or '-' to supply
        stdin/stdout respectively

          Main {
            input :i
            output :o

            def run
              i = params[:i].value
              o = params[:o].value

              line = i.gets
              o.puts line
            end
          }

       - clean up warnings running with 'ruby -w'

       - fix a failing test

       - ability to ignore parameters in sub modes

          Main {
            argument :foo
            argument :bar

            def run
              p param[:bar].value
            end

            mode :ignoring do
              params[:foo].ignore!
            end
          }
  4.0.0
    - avoid duping ios.  new methods Main.push_ios! and Main.pop_ios! are
    utilized for testing.  this was done to make it simple to wrap
    daemon/servolux programs around main, althought not strictly required.
    not the version bump - there is not reason to expect existing main
    programs to break, but it *is* and interface change which requires a major
    version bump.

  3.0.0
    - major refactor to support modes via module/extend vs. subclassing.
    MIGHT NOT be backward compatible, though no known issues thus far.

  2.9.0
    - support ruby 1.9

  2.8.3
    - support for block defaults


  2.8.2
    - fixes and tests for negative arity/attr arguments, options, eg

        argument(:foo){
          arity -1  
        }

        def run  # ARGV == %w( a b c )
          p foo  #=> %w( a b c )
        end

      thanks nathan

  2.8.1
    - move from attributes.rb to fattr.rb

  2.8.0 
    - added 'to_options' method for Parameter::Table.  this allows you to convert
      all the parameters to a simple hash.  
      for example

        Main {
          option 'foo'
          argument 'baz'

          run { puts params.to_options.inspect } 

        }

  2.7.0
    - removed bundled arrayfields and attributes.  these are now dependancies
      mananged by rubygems.  a.k.a. you must have rubygems installed for main
      to work.

  2.6.0
    - added 'mixin' feaature for storing, and later evaluating a block of
      code.  the purpose of this is for use with modes where you want to keep
      your code dry, but may not want to define something in the base class
      for all to inherit.  'mixin' allows you to define the code to inherit
      once and the selectively drop it in child classes (modes) on demand.
      for example

        Main {
          mixin :foobar do
            option 'foo'
            option 'bar'
          end

          mode :install do
            mixin :foobar
          end

          mode :uninstall do
            mixin :foobar
          end

          mode :clean do
          end
        }

    - mode definitions are now deferred to the end of the Main block, so you
      can do this

        Main {
          mode 'a' do
            mixin :foo
          end

          mode 'b' do
            mixin :foo
          end

          def inherited_method
            42
          end

          mixin 'foo' do
            def another_inherited_method
              'forty-two'
            end
          end
        }

    - added sanity check at end of paramter contruction

    - improved auto usage generation when arity is used with arguments

    - removed 'p' shortcut in paramerter dsl because it collided with
      Kernel.p.  it's now called 'param'.  this method is availble *inside* a
      parameter definition

        option('foo', 'f'){
          synopsis "arity = #{ param.arity }"
        }
      
    - fixed bug where '--' did not signal the end of parameter parsing in a
      getoptlong compliant way

    - added (before/after)_parse_parameters, (before/after)_initialize, and
      (before/after)_run hooks

    - fixed bug where adding to usage via

        usage['my_section'] = 'custom message'

      totally horked the default auto generated usage message

    - updated dependancies in gemspec.rb for attributes (~> 5.0.0) and
      arrayfields (~> 4.3.0)

    - check that client code defined run, iff not wrap_run! is called.  this is
      so mains with a mode, but no run defined, still function correctly when 
      passed a mode

    - added new shortcut for creating accessors for parameters.  for example

        option('foo'){
          argument :required
          cast :int
          attr
        }

        def run
          p foo ### this attr will return the parameter's *value*
        end

      a block can be passed to specify how to extract the value from the
      parameter

        argument('foo'){
          optional
          default 21 
          cast :int
          attr{|param| param.value * 2}
        }

        def run
          p foo #=> 42 
        end

    - fixed bug where 'abort("message")' would print "message" twice on exit
      if running under a nested mode (yes again - the fix in 2.4.0 wasn't
      complete)

    - added a time cast, which uses Time.parse

        argument('login_time'){ cast :time }

    - added a date cast, which uses Date.parse

        argument('login_date'){ cast :date }
    

  2.5.0
    - added 'examples', 'samples', and 'api' kewords to main dsl.  each
      keyword takes a list of strings which will be included in the help
      message
        
        Main {
          examples "foobar example", "barfoo example"

          samples <<-txt
            do this

            don't do that
          txt

          api %(
            foobar string, hash

            barfoo hash, string
          ) 
        }

      results in a usage message with sections like

      ...

      EXAMPLES
        foobar example
        barfoo example

      SAMPLES
        do this

        don't do that

      API
        foobar string, hash

        barfoo hash, string

      ...

  2.4.0
    - fixed bug where 'abort("message")' would print "message" twice on exit
      if running under a nested mode.

    - allowed parameters to be overridden completely in subclasses (modes)

  2.3.0
    - re-worked Main.new such that client code may define an #initialize
      methods and the class will continue to work.  that is to say it's fine
      to do this

        Main {
          def initialize
            @a = 42
          end

          def run
            p @a
          end

          mode 'foo' do
            def run
              p @a
            end
          end
        }

      the client #initialize will be called *after* main has done it's normal
      initialization so things like @argv, @env, and @stdin will all be there
      in initialize.  of course you could have done this before but you'd have
      to both call super and call it with the correct arguments - now you can
      simply ignore it.

  2.2.0
    - added ability for parameter dsl error handlers to accept an argument,
      this will be passed the current error.  for example

        argument(:x) do
          arity 42
        
          error do |e|
            case e
              when Parameter::Arity
            ...
          end
        end  

    - refined the mode parsing a bit: modes can now be abbreviated to uniqness
      and, when the mode is ambiuous, a nice error message is printed, for
      example:

        ambiguous mode: in = (inflate or install)?

  2.1.0
    - added custom error handling dsl for parameters, this includes the ability
      to prepend, append, or replace the standard error handlers:

        require 'main'

        Main {
          argument 'x' do
            error :before do
              puts 'this fires *before* normal error handling using #instance_eval...'
            end

            error do
              puts 'this fires *instead of* normal error handling using #instance_eval...'
            end

            error :after do
              puts 'this fires *after* normal error handling using #instance_eval...'
            end
          end
          
          run(){ p param['x'].given? }
        }

    - added ability to exit at any time bypassing *all* error handling using
      'throw :exit, 42' where 42 is the desired exit status.  throw without a
      status simply exits with 0.

    - added 'help!' method which simply dumps out usage and exits

  2.0.0
    - removed need for proxy.rb via Main::Base.wrap_run!
    - added error handling hooks for parameter parsing
    - bundled arrayfields, attributes, and pervasives although gems are tried
      first
    - softened error messages for parameter parsing errors: certain classes of
      errors are now 'softspoken' and print only the message, not the entire
      stacktrace, to stderr.  much nicer for users.  this is configurable.
    - added subcommand/mode support
    - added support for user defined exception handling on top level
      exceptions/exits
    - added support for negative arity.  this users ruby's own arity
      semantics, for example:
      
        lambda{|*a|}.arity     == -1
        lambda{|a,*b|}.arity   == -2
        lambda{|a,b,*c|}.arity == -3
        ...

      in otherwords parameters now support 'zero or more', 'one or more' ...
      'n or more' argument semantics

  1.0.0
    - some improved usage messages from jeremy hinegardner

  0.0.2
    - removed dependancy on attributes/arrayfields.  main now has zero gem
      dependancies.

    - added support for io redirection.  redirection of stdin, stdout, and
      stderr can be done to any io like object or object that can be
      inerpreted as a pathname (object.to_s)

    - main objects can now easily be created and run on demand, which makes
      testing a breeze

        def test_unit_goodness!
          main = 
            Main.new{
              stdout StringIO.new 
              stderr '/dev/null'

              def run
                puts 42
              end
            }

          main.run
          main.stdout.rewind

          assert main.stdout.read == "42\n"
        end

    - added API section to readme and called it 'docs'

    - wrote a bunch more tests.  there are now 42 of them.

  0.0.1

    initial version.  this version extracts much of the functionality of alib's
    (gen install alib) Alib.script main program generator and also some of jim's
    freeze's excellent CommandLine::Aplication into what i hope is a simpler and
    more unified interface
